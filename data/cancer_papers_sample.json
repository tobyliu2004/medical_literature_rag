    "abstract": "Lung cancer accounts for a relatively high proportion of malignant tumors. As the most prevalent type of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by high morbidity and mortality. Presently, the arsenal of treatment strategies encompasses surgical resection, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiotherapy. However, despite these options, the prognosis remains distressingly poor with a low 5-year survival rate. Therefore, it is urgent to pursue a paradigm shift in treatment methodologies. In recent years, the advent of sophisticated biotechnologies and interdisciplinary integration has provided innovative approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. This article reviews the cutting-edge developments in the nano drug delivery system, molecular targeted treatment system, photothermal treatment strategy, and immunotherapy for lung cancer. Overall, by systematically summarizing and critically analyzing the latest progress and current challenges in these treatment strategies of lung cancer, we aim to provide a theoretical basis for the development of novel drugs for lung cancer treatment, and thus improve the therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the primary cause of mortality in the United States and around the globe. Therapeutic options for lung cancer treatment include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy. Medical management is often associated with the development of treatment resistance leading to relapse. Immunotherapy is profoundly altering the approach to cancer treatment owing to its tolerable safety profile, sustained therapeutic response due to immunological memory generation, and effectiveness across a broad patient population. Different tumor-specific vaccination strategies are gaining ground in the treatment of lung cancer. Recent advances in adoptive cell therapy (CAR T, TCR, TIL), the associated clinical trials on lung cancer, and associated hurdles are discussed in this review. Recent trials on lung cancer patients (without a targetable oncogenic driver alteration) reveal significant and sustained responses when treated with programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Accumulating evidence indicates that a loss of effective anti-tumor immunity is associated with lung tumor evolution. Therapeutic cancer vaccines combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can achieve better therapeutic effects. To this end, the present article encompasses a detailed overview of the recent developments in the immunotherapeutic landscape in targeting small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, the review also explores the implication of nanomedicine in lung cancer immunotherapy as well as the combinatorial application of traditional therapy along with immunotherapy regimens. Finally, ongoing clinical trials, significant obstacles, and the future outlook of this treatment strategy are also highlighted to boost further research in the field.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent subtype of lung cancer. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or molecularly targeted therapy is used to treat NSCLC. Nevertheless, many patients who accept surgery likely develop distant metastases or local recurrence. In recent years, targeted treatments and immunotherapy have achieved improvement at a breakneck pace. Therapy must be customized for each patient based on the specific medical condition, as well as other variables. It is critical to have an accurate NSCLC sub-classification for tailored treatment, according to the latest World Health Organization standards.",

    "abstract": "Since the past decades, more lung cancer patients have been experiencing lasting benefits from immunotherapy. It is imperative to accurately and intelligently select appropriate patients for immunotherapy or predict the immunotherapy efficacy. In recent years, machine learning (ML)-based artificial intelligence (AI) was developed in the area of medical-industrial convergence. AI can help model and predict medical information. A growing number of studies have combined radiology, pathology, genomics, proteomics data in order to predict the expression levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), tumor mutation burden (TMB)Â and tumor microenvironment (TME) in cancer patients or predict the likelihood of immunotherapy benefits and side effects. Finally, with the advancement of AI and ML, it is believed that \"digital biopsy\" can replace the traditional single assessment method to benefit more cancer patients and help clinical decision-making in the future. In this review, the applications of AI in PD-L1/TMB prediction, TME prediction and lung cancer immunotherapy are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Surgery is the most potentially curative therapeutic option for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The five-year survival for these patients remains poor and variable, depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis, and the risk of recurrence following tumor resection is high. During the last 20 years, there has been a modest improvement in the therapeutic strategies for resectable NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), alone or in combination with chemotherapy, have become the cornerstone for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC patients. Recently, their clinical development has been shifted in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings where they have demonstrated remarkable efficacy, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Based on the positive results from phase III trials, ICIs have become a therapeutic option in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. On October 2021 the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atezolizumab as an adjuvant treatment following surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 â¥ 1%. In March 2022, nivolumab in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was approved for adult patients with resectable NSCLC in the neoadjuvant setting. The current review provides an updated overview of the clinical trials exploring the role of immunotherapy in patients with early-stage NSCLC, focusing on the biological rationale for their use in the perioperative setting. We will also discuss the role of potential predictive biomarkers to personalize therapy and optimize the incorporation of immunotherapy into the multimodality management of stage I-III NSCLC.",
